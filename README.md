# DoggyDoo

Developed by Dror Houminer & Inbar Mizrahi.

Doggy Doo is an information system designed to improve inventory management and monitoring of dog waste bag stations within municipalities.
It enables real-time tracking of bag inventory, resident reporting of empty or dirty stations, and performance monitoring of maintenance staff.
The system includes GPS functionality to help residents locate stocked stations, as well as customizable alerts for both residents and system managers.
Developed using Django, MongoDB, and other web technologies, Doggy Doo streamlines processes and enhances service quality for local authorities and residents.
